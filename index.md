Wobscale is a Seattle-based creative technology collective. We defy simple explanation, existing as both a parody of modern tech while simultaneously embodying it.

We exist partially to poke fun at the industry, but also as a front for an eclectic collection of projects. We explicitly eschew making money in favor of having fun and working on things we care about.

Join us on IRC at [#wob on irc.wobscale.website](ircs://irc.wobscale.website:6697/#wob) or via our Matrix bridge at [#wob:wobscale.chat](https://matrix.to/#/#wob:wobscale.chat). **Participation is subject to our [code of conduct](conduct.html).**

We're on Mastodon at [@wobscale@wobscale.social](https://wobscale.social/@wobscale).

You can attempt to contact us at [contact@wobscale.website](mailto:contact@wobscale.website). Please don't try to sell us things.
