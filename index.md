Wobscale is a Seattle-based creative technology collective. We poke fun at terms like *web scale* and *the cloud* while also swearing by them in the same breath.

Join us on IRC at [#wob on irc.wobscale.website](ircs://irc.wobscale.website:6697/wob) or via our Matrix bridge at [#wob:wobscale.chat](https://matrix.to/#/#wob:wobscale.chat). **Participation is subject to our [code of conduct](/conduct.html).**

We're on Mastodon at [@wobscale@wobscale.social](https://wobscale.social/@wobscale).

[**We have free stickers!**](https://stickers.wob.app/)

You can attempt to contact us at [contact@wobscale.website](mailto:contact@wobscale.website). Please don't try to sell us things.
